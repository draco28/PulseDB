## 4. Resource Allocation

### 4.1 Development Effort

| Phase | Weeks | Story Points | Hours (Est) |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Foundation | 4 | 37 | 60-80 |
| Substrate | 4 | 57 | 80-100 |
| Polish | 2 | 18 | 30-40 |
| **Total** | **10** | **112** | **170-220** |

## 5. Risk Register

### 5.1 Technical Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|------------|--------|------------|
| T1 | hnswlib FFI complexity | Medium | High | Start early, have pure Rust fallback |
| T2 | ONNX model size bloats binary | Medium | Medium | Make optional, lazy loading |
| T3 | Performance targets not met | Low | High | Early benchmarking, profiling |
| T4 | redb limitations discovered | Low | High | Evaluate early, have backup plan |
| T5 | Cross-platform issues | Medium | Medium | CI on all platforms from start |

### 5.2 Resource Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|------------|--------|------------|
| R1 | Solo developer bottleneck | High | Medium | Prioritize ruthlessly, MVP only |
| R2 | Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict out-of-scope list |
| R3 | Timeline slip | Medium | Medium | Buffer in schedule, cut scope |
| R4 | Burnout | Medium | High | Sustainable pace, take breaks |

### 5.3 External Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|------------|--------|------------|
| E1 | Competitor releases similar | Low | Medium | First-mover advantage |
| E2 | Dependency breaks | Low | Medium | Pin versions, test on CI |
| E3 | PulseHive requirements change | Medium | Medium | Flexible SubstrateProvider |

### 5.4 Risk Response Plan

| Risk Level | Response |
|------------|----------|
| High (>= 2 risks triggered) | Scope reduction, timeline extension |
| Medium (1 risk triggered) | Overtime, reprioritize backlog |
| Low (0 risks triggered) | Proceed as planned |
